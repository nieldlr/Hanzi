# HanziJS

HanziJS is a Chinese character and NLP module for Chinese language processing for Node.js. It is primarily written to help provide a framework for Chinese language learners to explore Chinese.

At present features include:
*	Character decomposition into components
*	Dictionary definition lookup using CC-CEDICT

Future features planned:
*	Chinese sentence segmentation
*	Determine regularities and other variables between characters & their components.

Currently the data was generated by Gavin Grover

Install
========================
```javascript
npm install hanzi
```

How to use
========================

```javascript
//Require
var hanzi = require("hanzi");
//Initiate
hanzi.start();
//Decompose Characters - Returns a parsed JSON object with the fields: 
//"character" (String), "components1", "components2" & "components3" (Array).
//Type of Decomposition: 1 = Once (returns only two components), 2 = Radical. 3 = Graphical. 
//If no parameter is given it returns all possible decompositions. This is used by default.
var decomposition = hanzi.decompose('搬');
console.log(decomposition.character); 
搬
console.log(decomposition.components1);
[扌,般]
console.log(decomposition.components2);
[㇚,二,舟,殳]
console.log(decomposition.components3);
[㇚,二,㇑,㇆,㇔,⺀,㇐,㇓,㇠,㇇,㇏]

//If a type of decomposition is forced (eg. hanzi.decompose('搬', 1);) then it returns only two fields: 
//"character" & "components"
```
